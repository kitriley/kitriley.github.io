                <br><br>
                Change is hard! Make a plan, take it slow, and be kind to yourself
                <br><br>
                Surround yourself with supportive friends
                <br><br>
                Act normal around those with prejudicial opinions

            <p>
            In my years as a psychiatric patient, my experience with medications did not match the usual medical narrative, but my own narratives
            were routinely interpreted as evidence of further illness, not as evidence of a differing need.
            <br><br>
            Even in more open mental health communities, I often felt pressures to minimise and caveat the stories I told about myself - to reassure people,
            "don't worry, I know that my experience is my own problem." I think one intention with social practices such as these is to make sure no-one feels
            like their experiences are being erased. Although I appreciate this sentiment, I find that when I perform these repetitive speech acts in order to talk
            about areas of my life which are already erased by most of my society, then I act as my own eraser.
            <br><br>
            In this work, I aimed to present psychiatric alternatives without caveat or context. The banner presents no theories, describes no social contexts, and
            offers no ameliorating statements regarding medication or the medical model of mental illness. It simply expresses a possibility for people to try for
            themselves, investigate further, reject outright, or ignore altogether.
            <br><br>
            Perhaps I am not as bold now as I was then, because I apparently felt it necessary to provide the viewer with this context after all.
